Generate Sitting Arrangement according to the following criteria using JavaScript 

1. The classroom will have following details
{classroom_Number:1,number_of_Columns:2,number_Of_Rows_In_Each_Columns:15,subjects_In_Classrooms:[“Subject1”,”Subject2”,…]}.

2. We will also get map of list which contains students in object form in which
contains {stu_id:” S001”, subject:” Subject1”}.

3. There should be only two columns in one classroom, each column will have some numbers of columns but not less than 10 and not greater than 20, for just now, assign then randomly.


4. Now, we have total number of students and total number of classrooms and total
number of rows in one classroom, now calculate that if we make 3 students to be
seated in one row of any column and the seats for total students are enough then
make it confirm that there will be 3 students in each row of any column and if
the classroom gets excess then make it confirm that only two students will be
seated in one row of any column of any class. 


5. If the class will get fall short then try increasing number of students in each row and continue this
process until classes become complete for total students and if the students
fall short then leave the remaining class empty as it is. 


6. It is necessary to have at least 2 different subjects in each classroom. 


7. All different subjects will have students with starting roll for example subject1 has student with roll 1, 2, 3…as on and Subject2 will also have roll 1, 2, 3… as on similarly for all subjects. 


8. Apply proper CSS and HTML to give a classroom view in which classroom have classroom number and column number at the top of the box and the column1 and column2 will look like left and right aligned.
